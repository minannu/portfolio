                <h3>Teaching Physics, Mathematics, and ICT</h3>
                <p>As a tutor, I have taught physics, mathematics, and information and communication technology (ICT) to students of classes 9-10 and HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate) level. My teaching approach emphasizes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conceptual Understanding: Focusing on building a strong foundation of concepts in physics, mathematics, and ICT.</li>
                    <li>Problem-Solving Skills: Helping students develop analytical and problem-solving skills through practice and application of concepts.</li>
                    <li>Interactive Learning: Engaging students in interactive sessions to encourage active participation and deeper understanding.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My goal is to empower students with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in their academic pursuits and beyond.</p>

                <h3>Informal Teaching of Departmental Subjects</h3>
                <p>In addition to formal tutoring, I have also informally taught departmental subjects to students. This includes providing guidance and assistance in subjects related to my field of expertise, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[object oriented programming]</li>
                    <li>[Data structure and Algorithm]</li>
                   
                </ul>
                <p>Through informal teaching, I aim to share my knowledge and expertise with students in a supportive and collaborative learning environment.</p>
